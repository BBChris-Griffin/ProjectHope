A demo for the 2D platformer video game that I am currently developing.

The full game will have new sprite designs, music, and an actual story.
Some of the sprites (particularly the some of the animations for the main character and the first level) were
created by Unity's own developers for a tutorial. 
However, the rest of the main character's animations as well as most of the sprites of the second level were create by me.

This demo was made purely to showcase the gameplay of the upcoming video game.
