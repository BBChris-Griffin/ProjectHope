A demo for the 2D platformer video game that I am currently developing.

The full game will have new sprite designs, music, and an actual story.
Some of the sprites (particularly the some of the animations for the main character and the first level) were
created by Unity's own developers for a tutorial. 
However, the rest of the main character's animations as well as most of the sprites of the second level were create by me.

This demo was made purely to showcase the gameplay of the upcoming video game.

To play, simple download the files above and run the .exe.

UPDATE!!!:
The game can only be played on a Windows computer at the moment. I have an idea to fix this but I thought I'd go ahead and announce it.
Just to clarify, the reason for this is because Apple computers cannot run .exe files directly. With that being said, there technically is a way for Apple user to play it, but it will require more work on the user's end. You would simply have to convert the .exe to a .dmg, I believe (I cannot do that on a Windows computer). Regardless, I will aim to have the game easily accessible to Apple users soon.
